Javadoc attempts to use its own context classloader\ntools.jar but ignores one that may have already been set, which leads\nto some classes being loaded into two different classloaders.  The\ntelltale sign of this problem is a javadoc error message saying that\n\'languageVersion() must return LanguageVersion - you might see this\nmessage in your process\' output.\n\nThis will hopefully be fixed in a later release of JDK 1.5; if a new\nversion of 1.5 has become available, you might be able to solve this\nby simply upgrading to the latest JDK.\n\nAlternatively, you can work around it by simply including \n$JAVA_HOME/lib/tools.jar in the java -classpath\nparameter.  If you are running ant, you will need to modify the standard\nant script to include tools.jar in the -classpath.\n"
